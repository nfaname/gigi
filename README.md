The GIGI Landing Page is a modern single-page application built with React and Vite, enhanced by smooth animations powered by Framer Motion. It is designed as a stylish product showcase with a strong focus on interactivity and motion design.

At the heart of the page lies an auto-playing, looping video that seamlessly integrates into the scrolling flow. As the user scrolls, product tiles move vertically with a parallax effect, creating a dynamic browsing experience that feels fluid and engaging. The layout is fully responsive, ensuring the landing page adapts beautifully to both mobile devices and large desktop screens.

The code structure is clean and modular: assets such as images and videos are stored in a dedicated folder, styles are organized separately, and the main content is handled inside a ContentSection component where the animations are defined using useScroll and useTransform. This makes the project easy to maintain, extend, and customize.

To get started, simply clone the repository, install dependencies, and run the development server with Vite. The project is ready for deployment on platforms such as Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.

The GIGI Landing Page is more than just a static site â€” it is an animated digital experience that highlights products in a visually captivating way, blending modern frontend technologies with smooth, scroll-based storytelling.
